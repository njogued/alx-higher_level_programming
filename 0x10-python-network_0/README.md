## 0x10. Python - Network #0

### Concepts
[Resource](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/HTTP_Basics.html)
#### HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- HTTP is an application layer (Layer #7) protocol [designed to transmit data between a webserver and the client](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/network-security/what-is-the-osi-model-understanding-the-7-layers/#:~:text=The%20application%20layer%20includes%20protocols,web%20server%20and%20a%20client.)  
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat): Imagine that the internet is like a vast library of information, and each web page is like a book in that library. HTTP is like the librarian who helps you find and retrieve the book you're looking for.  
- When a user tries to access a URL, the browser sends a HTTP request to the server hosting the web server. The server sends a HTTP response back with the page requested and other info necessary such as images, CSS, & JavaScript code.

#### HTTP Request Messages 
- The URL (Uniform Resource Locator), uniquely identifies a resource over the web. The URL has 4 parts: the protocol, hostname, port, path and file name.```protocol://hostname:port/path-and-file-name```
- The HTTP request message has: 
```
Request Line
Request Headers
<BLANK LINE>
Request Message Body (Optional)
```
- The request line is the first line of the header. The request line's syntax is ```request-method-name request-URI HTTP-version```
- The request header has name:value pairs with names such as Host, Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, User-Agent, Content-Length
- The HTTP request message may then be:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: njogued.tech
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
```
##### Request Methods
Request Methods include: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, others  

#### HTTP Response Messages
- The HTTP response message has:
```
Status Line
Response Headers
<BLANK LINE>
Response Message Body (optional)
```
The status line: ```HTTP-version status-code reason-phrase```
The response header has name:value pairs with names such as Content-Type, Content-Length, Connection, and Keep-Alive. 
##### Status Codes - [Resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
- Status codes are classified as:  
        100 - 199: Informational responses  
        200 - 299: Successful responses  
        300 - 399: Redirection messages  
        400 - 499: Client error responses  
        500 - 599: Server error responses  

- The HTTP response message may be:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 2023 17:02:51 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 13
Last-Modified: Tue, 28 Mar 2023 19:43:55 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "6423437b-d"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```
  
#### NOTE
- HTTP is stateless, ie. does not keep track of what has been done in the past.

### Task 0. cURL body size
- Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response
```
The size must be displayed in bytes
You have to use curl
```

### Task 1. cURL to the end
- Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
```
Display only body of a 200 status code response
You have to use curl
```

### 2. cURL Method
- Write a Bash script that sends a DELETE request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response
```
You have to use curl
```

### Task 3. cURL only methods
- Write a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.
```
You have to use curl
```

### Task 4. cURL headers
- Write a Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response
```
A header variable X-School-User-Id must be sent with the value 98
You have to use curl
```

### Task 5. cURL POST parameters
- Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a POST request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response
```
A variable email must be sent with the value test@gmail.com
A variable subject must be sent with the value I will always be here for PLD
You have to use curl
```

### Task 6. Find a peak
- Technical interview preparation:

- You are not allowed to google anything
- Whiteboard first
- Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
```
Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
You are not allowed to import any module
Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
6-peak.py must contain the function
6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
```
